title: MailChimp Integration with Elixir
---

While working on a Backend as a Service entirely built on top of [Elixir Lang](http://elixir-lang.org/),
I often come across with challenging requirements for such project. In order to share some useful solutions,
I am writing a serie of blog posts, in a simple, direct and pragmatic way.

The first requirement I had to met was a *Sign Up Service* which, besides persisting user data, sends a
confirmation link to user's e-mail. Rather than implement the whole mailer system, I opted to rely on MailChimp Services.
To do so, I have implemented [a basic Elixir wrapper for version 3 of the MailChimp API ](https://github.com/duartejc/mailchimp).
At the time of writing, that wrapper has a simple set of functionalities, such as **Getting Account Details**, **Getting All Lists** and **Adding a Member to a List**,
but it is very easy to implement other integrations.

As expected in Elixir projects, [adding a dependency](http://elixir-lang.org/getting-started/mix-otp/dependencies-and-umbrella-apps.html) is very simple.
Here we are going to use [version *0.0.3*](https://hex.pm/packages/mailchimp) of MailChimp API Wrapper:

```elixir
def deps do
  [{:mailchimp, "~> 0.0.3"}]
end
```

We also need to update our applications list to include the mailchimp project:

```elixir
def application do
  [applications: [:mailchimp]]
end
```

The last configuration step is to include your [API key](http://kb.mailchimp.com/accounts/management/about-api-keys) in *config.exs* file:

```elixir
config :mailchimp,
  apikey: "your api-us10"
```

2. Start a new process:

    Mailchimp.start_link

### Getting Account Details

    Mailchimp.get_account_details()

### Getting All Lists

    Mailchimp.get_all_lists()

### Adding a Member to a List

    Mailchimp.add_member("list_id", "e-mail")
